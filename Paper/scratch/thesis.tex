\begin{abstract}

  Trading strategies basing on both financial analysis and
  machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly popular
  due to their ability to capture micro market price movements
  and leverage big data. An important class of works are focusing
  on exploiting the structural relationships between companies
  for accurate stock price prediction. In this paper we develop
  an algorithm for learning the parameters of unary and binary
  potentials in binary markov random fields (MRFs) under the
  max-margin framework. We first show how to train unary
  potentials using market price data and Gaussian Mixture Models
  (GMMs). Then, we developed a graph-cut based algorithm to solve
  the inference problem exactly. We demonstrate the learning of
  potentials' parameters using a max-margin learning framework.
  Experiment is conducted by comparing performances between our
  formulation and conventional SVM method. Results show that our
  method outperforms SVM by 27.9\% on train set and 40.5\% on
  test set.
